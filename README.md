ABOUT
-----

For the lack of a fancy name, I shall call this Voting System VS-3. (3 for no apparent reason).
VS-3 is a simple nw.js based offline voting system.

SOUNDS
------

- The heart rate sound indicates that the application is still on and the voting is underway.
- The final beep sounds indicates the end of vote
